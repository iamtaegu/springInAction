# This sets the location of the Eureka server. The config shown here differs
# slightly from the config in chapter 13 in that it references a localhost
# Eureka instead of a Eureka at eureka1.tacocloud.com. That's because the
# domain in the book is made up for the sake of the example but doesn't really
# work. 
#
# It's also worth noting that since Eureka clients default to assume that there
# is a Eureka at http://localhost:8761/eureka/, setting this property explicitly
# to reference a local instance isn't strictly required.
